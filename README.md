COSI 236b Programming Assignment 1



popularity is the sum of all scores for each movie because if a movie had low scores, but a lot of people rated it, it is sill a popular movie

similarity sees is user1 has any movies rated in common with user2. If there is a common movie rated, 5-(the distance away from the ratings) is added to similarity, so ratings that are closer to each other have a higher similarity
